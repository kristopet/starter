# Plans & Future Features

This directory contains planned features and architectural decisions for future implementation.

## Philosophy

Following lean startup principles:
1. **Build** the minimum viable feature
2. **Measure** actual user behavior  
3. **Learn** what to build next

## Current Plans

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- [AI Chat Integration](../starter-ai-chat/) - Active development in worktree

### ðŸ“‹ Planned (When Needed)
- [Analytics Implementation](./analytics-implementation.md) - When we have 10+ users
- Payment tiers optimization - After first 5 paying customers
- API access - When users request it

### ðŸš« Not Planned (YAGNI)
- Mobile app - Unless users demand it
- Multi-language - Unless expanding internationally
- Complex permissions - Current role system is sufficient

## Adding New Plans

When adding a plan:
1. Create a markdown file: `feature-name.md`
2. Include: Context, Rationale, Phases, Success Criteria
3. Set clear trigger: "Implement when X happens"
4. Review quarterly

## Principles

- **No premature optimization**
- **User feedback drives priorities**
- **Revenue features first**
- **Keep it simple until it needs to be complex**

Remember: The best plan is the one that ships features users will pay for.
