# Analytics Implementation Plan

## Status: PLANNED (Not Urgent)

**Created**: 2024-07-31  
**Target**: When we have 10+ active users

## Context & Rationale

### Why Analytics (Eventually)
As a solo AI builder following lean startup principles, analytics should be implemented when we have actual users to measure. Before that, it's premature optimization.

### Why PostHog Over Alternatives

**PostHog** was chosen over Plausible, Google Analytics, and Mixpanel because:

1. **AI-Specific Tracking**: Can track custom events like token usage, model selection, generation time
2. **Free Tier**: 1M events/month free (plenty for early stage)
3. **Feature Flags**: Built-in A/B testing for AI model experiments
4. **Session Recording**: See exactly how users interact with AI features
5. **No Cookie Banners**: Can be configured for privacy-first tracking

**Plausible** was considered but rejected because:
- Only tracks page views (not enough for AI product insights)
- Costs $9/mo from day one
- Can't track custom AI events

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Pre-Analytics (Current State) ✅
- Ship features fast
- Get first users
- Manual feedback collection
- **Don't waste time on metrics without users**

### Phase 1: Basic Tracking (10+ Users)
Implement only these 3 events:
```typescript
posthog.capture('ai_chat_started')      // Activation
posthog.capture('ai_chat_completed')    // Success rate  
posthog.capture('user_upgraded')        // Revenue
```

**Why these three?**
- Activation: Are users trying the core feature?
- Success: Is it working for them?
- Revenue: Are they willing to pay?

### Phase 2: Usage Intelligence (50+ Users)
Add deeper insights:
```typescript
posthog.capture('ai_message_sent', {
  model: 'gpt-4',
  messageLength: 245,
  hasAttachment: false
})

posthog.capture('ai_generation_completed', {
  duration: 2.3,
  tokens: 850,
  error: false
})
```

### Phase 3: Feature Optimization (100+ Users)
- A/B test different models
- Track feature discovery
- Measure time-to-value
- Session recordings for UX issues

## Technical Implementation

### Quick Start (When Ready)
```bash
cd starter-ai-chat
pnpm add posthog-js
```

### Minimal Provider
```typescript
// app/providers/analytics.tsx
'use client'

import posthog from 'posthog-js'
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs'
import { useEffect } from 'react'

// Only init in production with real users
if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  posthog.init(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY!)
}

export function AnalyticsProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const { userId } = useAuth()
  
  useEffect(() => {
    if (userId && process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
      posthog.identify(userId)
    }
  }, [userId])

  return <>{children}</>
}
```

### Environment Variables
```env
# Only set these when you have users
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=phc_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://app.posthog.com
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Track Everything
- Vanity metrics waste time
- Focus on actions that matter
- Quality over quantity

### ❌ Don't Implement Too Early  
- No users = no data
- Time better spent on features
- Analytics can wait

### ❌ Don't Over-Engineer
- Start with 3 events max
- Add more only when needed
- Keep it simple

## Success Criteria

Analytics is successful when:
1. You learn why users upgrade (or don't)
2. You identify where AI interactions fail
3. You can measure feature impact on revenue

## Decision Log

- **2024-07-31**: Decided to postpone analytics until 10+ active users
- **Rationale**: Time better spent on core AI features
- **Review Date**: When first paying customer signs up

**Remember**: The best analytics is talking to users. Everything else is secondary.
